# ⚠️ ARCHIVED REPOSITORY

**This repository is ARCHIVED as of January 31, 2026.**

This dashboard was created on **January 27, 2026** to provide a simple web interface for phase approvals during the pre-migration period. It has been superseded by the **Agentic Software Factory** system.

## Historical Context
